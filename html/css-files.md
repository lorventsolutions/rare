# Css Files

We have a css file called app.css which is a combination of the following files:-

* bootstrap.css
* themify-icons.css

app.css is placed in the destination directory \(css/app.css\) which is done with the help of gulp. It is placed in all pages and also every page has its own css file which can be found in src/css/custom\_css/.
